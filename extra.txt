i am using app routing in my next.js app
in which i have created components like

src/app/page.jsx => // http://localhost:3000/  => LandingPage
src/app/(auth)/login/page.jsx => http://localhost:3000/login => LoginPage
src/app/(auth)/register/page.jsx => // http://localhost:3000/register =>RegisterPage


src/app/(panel)/admin/dashboard/page.jsx => // http://localhost:3000/admin/dashboard => Admin Dashboard
src/app/(panel)/agent/dashboard/page.jsx => // http://localhost:3000/agent/dashboard => Agent Dashboard
src/app/(panel)/client/dashboard/page.jsx => // http://localhost:3000/client/dashboard => Client Dashboard


i have implemented login feature and it redirect respective to the role of the user
but the problem is that if my client get login the client get redirected to it's client dashboard but the admin and agent dashboard are still accessible by client 
which is not good the client should have access to it's client routes
the agent should have access to it's agent routes
the admin should have access to it's admin routes
if the user is not authenticated only the loginPage, LandingPage and RegisterPage is accessbile
